# Useful GML Scripts

A collection of useful, reuseable GML script I've made over the years.

The scripts are divided into two categories:

### Standalone

A library of largely independent helper functions and structs that are easily integrated into any project.

### Components

A library of more complex prefabs, such as a control input manager and menu systems.

**NOTE:** *These are not 100% production-ready, mostly because they are not fully-documented.*
