# Useful GML Scripts

A collection of useful, reuseable GML script I've made over the years.

The scripts are divided into two categories:

## Standalone

A library of largely independent helper functions and structs that are easily integrated into any project.

## Components

A library of more complex prefabs. **NOTE:** *These are not 100% production-ready.*
